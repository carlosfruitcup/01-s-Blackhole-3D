# What is this proejct?
This a cancelled remake I was working on of my game 01's Blackhole,
I really disliked the result of the game, so one year after release I decided to remake the entire game from scratch.

# What are you making it open-source?
I'm not going to work on this game, so I decided to just release the remake as an open source project.
